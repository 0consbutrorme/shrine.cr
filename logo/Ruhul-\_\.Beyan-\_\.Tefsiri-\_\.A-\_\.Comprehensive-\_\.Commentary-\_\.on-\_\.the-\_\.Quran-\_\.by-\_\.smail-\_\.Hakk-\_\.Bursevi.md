Ruhul Beyan Tefsiri is not only a commentary on the Quran, but also a reflection of Ä°smail HakkÄ± Bursevi's spiritual journey and experiences. He wrote the tafsir over a period of 20 years, from 1698 to 1718, while traveling to various places, such as Istanbul, Bursa, Edirne, Damascus, Jerusalem, Mecca, and Medina. He also faced many hardships and challenges during this time, such as imprisonment, exile, persecution, and illness. He dedicated his work to his spiritual master and guide, Aziz Mahmud Hudayi, who was a prominent Sufi leader and scholar in the Ottoman Empire.
 
Ruhul Beyan Tefsiri is based on the principles of Sufism, which is the mystical dimension of Islam. Sufism emphasizes the importance of love, devotion, purification, and direct experience of God. Ä°smail HakkÄ± Bursevi was a follower of the Jelveti order of Sufism, which was founded by Jelaluddin Rumi's grandson Ulu Arif Celebi. The Jelveti order was known for its emphasis on poetry, music, and dance as means of spiritual expression and ecstasy. Ä°smail HakkÄ± Bursevi was also a prolific poet and composed many poems in Turkish and Persian languages. Some of his poems are included in his tafsir as examples of Quranic eloquence and beauty.
 
Ruhul Beyan Tefsiri is a valuable source of knowledge and inspiration for Muslims and non-Muslims alike. It offers a comprehensive and profound understanding of the Quran and its message. It also reveals the richness and diversity of Islamic culture and civilization. It is a testament to the creativity and wisdom of Ä°smail HakkÄ± Bursevi and his legacy as one of the greatest Sufi masters and Quranic commentators in history.
